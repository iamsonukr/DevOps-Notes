Q> Explain Agile in brief?

Agile is a set of methods and practices
that focuses on iterative development
Requirements and solutions are
obtained thanks to self-organizing
cross-functional teams collaborating

-----------------------------------------

Explain the difference between a traditional Waterfall model and Agile testing?

->Agile Model is a continuous iteration life cycle model for developing and testing a software
->Agile is flexible way 
->Agile Model is a highly collaborative
approach towards software
development, yielding a better output
->The entire process of development is
divided into sprints
->Changes may be made even after the
initial planning is completed
->Software development is a
collection of many different projects
->Testing is performed in the same
iteration as programming or building

Waterfall Model is a linear sequential life cycle model for developing and testing a software
->It  is a rigid way 
Waterfall Model is less flexible and
follows a sequence of steps, not
allowing the team to collaborate
->The software development process
is broken down into several phases
->Development requirements cannot
be changed once the project
development begins
->Software development is completed
as a single project or deliverable
->The testing phase comes after the
Build phase

-----------------------------------------

What are some important parts of the Agile process?

Self organised
simplicity
Constant Pace
changes in any phase

Explain Iterative and Incremental Development in Agile.

-> Incremental Development
With Incremental Development, the
process is divided into small workable
increments
Each successive increment builds on
top of the work done in the previous
increments
Over time, functionalities are added based on what was already created

->Iterative Development
Iterative Development
Iterative development involves the
development of a system by following
repeated cycles or iterations
Based on the results from the most
recent iteration of the process, changes
are made. This helps the project evolve
over time 

Agile - Iterative + Incremental
Agile involves consideration and
creation of a working product in an
iteration, which is part of the overall
final product
Each iteration is an enhanced working
increment of the final product
This process continues until all the
product functionalities are satisfied

Agile - Iterative + Incremental
Organizations and users can use and
experience the product and provide
feedback that can be incorporated into
the next iteration
Causing product roadmaps to be built,
produced, tested and confirmed before
the next iteration

What are the Different Types of Agile Methodologies?

Extreme Programming
It is a framework that enables teams
to create high-quality software and
improves their quality of life
It enables software development
with the appropriate engineering
practices

Kanban
This method is used to design,
manage and improve the flow of
systems
Organizations can visualize their
flow of work and limiting their work
in progress

Lean
• Lean is a set of tools and principles
that aims to identify and remove
waste to increase the speed of
process development
It focuses on maximizing value to
the client, ensuring waste is
minimized

Scrum
Scrum is a framework that is used
by teams to establish a hypothesis,
try it out, reflect on the experience
and adjust
It is used to enable teams to
incorporate practices from other
frameworks depending on the
team's requirements

Crystal
Crystal is an approach to software
development that focuses on
people and their interactions, rather
than tools and processes
It is aimed to streamline processes
and improve optimization
It works on the principle that
projects are unique and dynamic


--------------------------------------

What are the Principles of Agile Testing?

Testing continuously to ensure the
product improves continuously
Obtain feedback continuously to
ensure the product meets business
requirements
All team roles (testing, development,
etc.) need to be involved in the testing
process


The active involvement of the business
team and representatives can provide
quick feedback for each iteration
Clean and simplified code ensures it to
be defect—free during the iteration
The documentation created must be
limited into a particular iteration


------------------------------------------------------------------------

) What are some Agile Metrics that Need to be Focused on?

Some of the popular metrics are:
Measuring the burndown of
deliverables, which is usually
represented using burndown charts
Velocity
Lead Time
Cycle Time
Code Quality
Code Covered in Unit Test
Deployment Success Rate
Net Promoter Score

------------------------------------------------------------------
What Is Kanban?

Kanban system is visual system that
enables better management of work
as it moves through the processes
It visualizes & provides visibility into
the process, workflows and the work
passing through the process.

Difference between agile and scrum 

What Is It?
Agile
Agile is a set of principles that's
iterative and incremental in
nature

Scrum
Scrum is an implementation of
the agile methodology

Agile
The Agile manifesto and 12
principles help an organization
become agile
Guidelines

Scrum
Used in projects where the
requirements are constantly
changing. It also adheres to agile
principles
