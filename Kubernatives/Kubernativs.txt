Kubernetes (K8s) is open source system for 
Automating deployment, 
Management of containerized apps and scaling
Container orchestration

usecase of using K8s -> 

When you deploy Kubernatese, you get a cluseter.
Two important parts are :
-> Master (Control Plane)
-> Worker Node

There and multiple docker container deployed on multiple servers and each server is connected to the Kubernatives through a container 
-> Each server is called worker node
-> Each woker node has a kubernative agent called kubelet 
=> MASTER -> API  Server, Schedular , ETCD , Control Manager
=> Worker Node -> Kubelet , kube-proxy , contianer-runtime

Different Components of K8s
1> API Server -> It provides interface 
2> Container runtime -> Assign node to newly created Pods
3> ETCD -> Key value store , having all cluster data
4> Kube Proxy -> responsible for managing the state of cluster
5> Schedular
6> Kubelet 
7> kube controller

Q> What is PODs in K8s
A> A single instance of a running process in a cluster. It can run one or more containers and share the same resource.
